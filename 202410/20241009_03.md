## 背景      
当JOIN多个字段时, 如果上层节点输入的数据是JOIN前置列(s)并且已经有排序, 那么在使用mergejoin时会采用incremental sort.

Consider explicit incremental sort for mergejoins  
  
For a mergejoin, if the given outer path or inner path is not already  
well enough ordered, we need to do an explicit sort.  Currently, we  
only consider explicit full sort and do not account for incremental  
sort.  
  
In this patch, for the outer path of a mergejoin, we choose to use  
explicit incremental sort if it is enabled and there are presorted  
keys.  For the inner path, though, we cannot use incremental sort  
because it does not support mark/restore at present.  
  
The rationale is based on the assumption that incremental sort is  
always faster than full sort when there are presorted keys, a premise  
that has been applied in various parts of the code.  In addition, the  
current cost model tends to favor incremental sort as being cheaper  
than full sort in the presence of presorted keys, making it reasonable  
not to consider full sort in such cases.  
  
It could be argued that what if a mergejoin with an incremental sort  
as the outer path is selected as the inner path of another mergejoin.  
However, this should not be a problem, because mergejoin itself does  
not support mark/restore either, and we will add a Material node on  
top of it anyway in this case (see final_cost_mergejoin).  
  
There is one ensuing plan change in the regression tests, and we have  
to modify that test case to ensure that it continues to test what it  
is intended to.  
  
No backpatch as this could result in plan changes.
