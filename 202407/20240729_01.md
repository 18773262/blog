Reduce memory used by partitionwise joins  
  
In try_partitionwise_join, we aim to break down the join between two  
partitioned relations into joins between matching partitions.  To  
achieve this, we iterate through each pair of partitions from the two  
joining relations and create child-join relations for them.  With  
potentially thousands of partitions, the local objects allocated in  
each iteration can accumulate significant memory usage.  Therefore, we  
opt to eagerly free these local objects at the end of each iteration.  
  
In line with this approach, this patch frees the bitmap set that  
represents the relids of child-join relations at the end of each  
iteration.  Additionally, it modifies build_child_join_rel() to reuse  
the AppendRelInfo structures generated within each iteration.
