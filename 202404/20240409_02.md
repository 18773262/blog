Transform OR clauses to ANY expression

Replace (expr op C1) OR (expr op C2) ... with expr op ANY(ARRAY[C1, C2, ...])
on the preliminary stage of optimization when we are still working with the
expression tree.

Here Cn is a n-th constant expression, 'expr' is non-constant expression, 'op'
is an operator which returns boolean result and has a commuter (for the case
of reverse order of constant and non-constant parts of the expression,
like 'Cn op expr').

Sometimes it can lead to not optimal plan.  This is why there is a
or_to_any_transform_limit GUC.  It specifies a threshold value of length of
arguments in an OR expression that triggers the OR-to-ANY transformation.
Generally, more groupable OR arguments mean that transformation will be more
likely to win than to lose.

`or_to_any_transform_limit` (boolean) 

Sets the minimum length of arguments in an OR expression exceeding which planner will try to lookup and group multiple similar OR expressions to ANY (Section 9.25.3) expressions. The grouping technique of this transformation is based on the equivalence of variable sides. One side of such an expression must be a constant clause, and the other must contain a variable clause. The default value is 5. The value of -1 completely disables the transformation.

The advantage of this OR-to-ANY transformation is faster query planning and execution. In certain cases, this transformation also leads to more effective plans containing a single index scan instead of multiple bitmap scans. However, it may also cause a planning regression when distinct OR arguments are better to match to distinct indexes. This may happen when they have different matching partial indexes or have different distributions of other columns used in the query. Generally, more groupable OR arguments mean that transformation will be more likely to win than to lose.

For example, this query has its set of five OR expressions transformed to ANY with the default value of or_to_any_transform_limit. But not with the increased value.

例子
```
# EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE key = 1 OR key = 2 OR key = 3 OR key = 4 OR key = 5;
                     QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tbl  (cost=0.00..51.44 rows=64 width=4)
   Filter: (key = ANY ('{1,2,3,4,5}'::integer[]))
(2 rows)

# SET or_to_any_transform_limit = 6;
SET

# EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE key = 1 OR key = 2 OR key = 3 OR key = 4 OR key = 5;
                                QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tbl  (cost=0.00..67.38 rows=63 width=4)
   Filter: ((key = 1) OR (key = 2) OR (key = 3) OR (key = 4) OR (key = 5))
(2 rows)
```
