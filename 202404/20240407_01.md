## 背景      
PostgreSQL 16 引入了VACUUM/ANALYZE BUFFER_USAGE_LIMIT option, 设置为较大对值可以降低vacuum造成的wal flush频率, 提升vacuum速度. 同时有一个GUC参数来控制其默认值: `vacuum_buffer_usage_limit`    
  
[《PostgreSQL 16 preview - Add VACUUM/ANALYZE BUFFER_USAGE_LIMIT option - 减少vacuum造成的wal flush, 提升vacuum速度》](../202304/20230407_03.md)    
  
vacuum_buffer_usage_limit本质上是控制vacuum时最对使用多少shared buffer内存, 默认128k太小, 所以PostgreSQL 17把默认值调大了一些.    
  
Buffer Access Strategy   
  
Some operations will access a large number of pages. A Buffer Access Strategy helps to prevent these operations from evicting too many pages from shared buffers.  
  
A Buffer Access Strategy sets up references to a limited number of shared buffers and reuses them circularly. When the operation requires a new page, a victim buffer is chosen from the buffers in the strategy ring, which may require flushing the page's dirty data and possibly also unflushed WAL to permanent storage.  
  
Buffer Access Strategies are used for various operations such as `sequential scans of large tables, VACUUM, COPY, CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, ALTER TABLE, CREATE DATABASE, CREATE INDEX, and CLUSTER`.    
  
```  
-#vacuum_buffer_usage_limit = 256kB # size of vacuum and analyze buffer access strategy ring;  
+#vacuum_buffer_usage_limit = 2MB   # size of vacuum and analyze buffer access strategy ring;  
```

Increase default vacuum_buffer_usage_limit to 2MB.  
  
The BAS_VACUUM ring size has been 256kB since commit d526575f introduced  
the mechanism 17 years ago.  Commit 1cbbee03 recently made it  
configurable but retained the traditional default.  The correct default  
size has been debated for years, but 256kB is certainly very small.  
VACUUM soon needs to write back data it dirtied only 32 blocks ago,  
which usually requires flushing the WAL.  New experiments in prefetching  
pages for VACUUM exacerbated the problem by crashing into dirty data  
even sooner.  Let's make the default 2MB.  That's 1.6% of the default  
toy buffer pool size, and 0.2% of 1GB, which would be a considered a  
small shared_buffers setting for a real system these days.  Users are  
still free to set the GUC to a different value.
