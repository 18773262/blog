## 背景  
PostgreSQL 17被打回的一个patch, PostgreSQL 18重新支持:    
- [《PostgreSQL 17 preview - 简化exclude约束用法, 对primary key,unique约束增加without overlaps可选项》](../202401/20240125_01.md)    
  
下面解释了被打回的原因, 因此目前仅支持range,multirange两种类型.

Add temporal PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints  
  
Add WITHOUT OVERLAPS clause to PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints.  
These are backed by GiST indexes instead of B-tree indexes, since they  
are essentially exclusion constraints with = for the scalar parts of  
the key and && for the temporal part.  
  
(previously committed as 46a0cd4cefb, reverted by 46a0cd4cefb; the new  
part is this:)  
  
Because 'empty' && 'empty' is false, the temporal PK/UQ constraint  
allowed duplicates, which is confusing to users and breaks internal  
expectations.  For instance, when GROUP BY checks functional  
dependencies on the PK, it allows selecting other columns from the  
table, but in the presence of duplicate keys you could get the value  
from any of their rows.  So we need to forbid empties.  
  
This all means that at the moment we can only support ranges and  
multiranges for temporal PK/UQs, unlike the original patch (above).  
Documentation and tests for this are added.  But this could  
conceivably be extended by introducing some more general support for  
the notion of "empty" for other types.
