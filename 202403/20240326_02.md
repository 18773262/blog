## 背景    
union 有去重的需要, 当多个子查询union时, 原来优化器把union放在所有结果中执行, 现在可以让子查询按union字段有序返回, 然后通过merge append在merge过程中去重, 有效提升了性能.  
  
Here we adjust the union planner so that it can request that each subquery produce results in target list order so that these can be Merge Appended together and made unique with a Unique node.

Allow planner to use Merge Append to efficiently implement UNION  
  
Until now, UNION queries have often been suboptimal as the planner has  
only ever considered using an Append node and making the results unique  
by either using a Hash Aggregate, or by Sorting the entire Append result  
and running it through the Unique operator.  Both of these methods  
always require reading all rows from the union subqueries.  
  
Here we adjust the union planner so that it can request that each subquery  
produce results in target list order so that these can be Merge Appended  
together and made unique with a Unique node.  This can improve performance  
significantly as the union child can make use of the likes of btree  
indexes and/or Merge Joins to provide the top-level UNION with presorted  
input.  This is especially good if the top-level UNION contains a LIMIT  
node that limits the output rows to a small subset of the unioned rows as  
cheap startup plans can be used.
