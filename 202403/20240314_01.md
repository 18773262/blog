## 背景     
Roles with MAINTAIN on a relation may run VACUUM, ANALYZE, REINDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZE VIEW, CLUSTER, and LOCK TABLE on the relation.  
  
Roles with privileges of pg_maintain may run those same commands on all relations.

Reintroduce MAINTAIN privilege and pg_maintain predefined role.  
  
Roles with MAINTAIN on a relation may run VACUUM, ANALYZE, REINDEX,  
REFRESH MATERIALIZE VIEW, CLUSTER, and LOCK TABLE on the relation.  
Roles with privileges of pg_maintain may run those same commands on  
all relations.  
  
This was previously committed for v16, but it was reverted in  
commit 151c22deee due to concerns about search_path tricks that  
could be used to escalate privileges to the table owner.  Commits  
2af07e2f74, 59825d1639, and c7ea3f4229 resolved these concerns by  
restricting search_path when running maintenance commands.  
  
Bumps catversion.
