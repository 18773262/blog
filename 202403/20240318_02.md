Add RETURNING support to MERGE.  
  
This allows a RETURNING clause to be appended to a MERGE query, to  
return values based on each row inserted, updated, or deleted. As with  
plain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands, the returned values are  
based on the new contents of the target table for INSERT and UPDATE  
actions, and on its old contents for DELETE actions. Values from the  
source relation may also be returned.  
  
As with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, the output of MERGE ... RETURNING may be  
used as the source relation for other operations such as WITH queries  
and COPY commands.  
  
Additionally, a special function merge_action() is provided, which  
returns 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', or 'DELETE', depending on the action  
executed for each row. The merge_action() function can be used  
anywhere in the RETURNING list, including in arbitrary expressions and  
subqueries, but it is an error to use it anywhere outside of a MERGE  
query's RETURNING list.
