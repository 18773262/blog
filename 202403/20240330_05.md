## 背景

As part of the Xata launch week, we are introducing pgzx, an open-source framework for developing PostgreSQL extensions written in Zig. It provides a set of utilities (e.g. error handling, memory allocators, wrappers) as well as a build and development environment to simplify integrating with the Postgres codebase.  
  
Zig is described on its website as a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software. Zig is a new language (pre 1.0), but it has been gaining popularity in the systems programming community. It is fair to think of it as a "modern C", providing safer memory management, compilation time code execution (comptime), and a rich standard library. We'll show some of these features in the context of Postgres extensions below.  
  
A major reason to use Zig for Postgres development is its ability to interoperate with C code. Zig supports the C ABI, works with C pointers and data types, including NULL terminated strings, and can even translate C header files into Zig code. Zig's automatic translation of C macros to Zig code is not yet perfect, but it's still helpful. This makes Zig a great choice for working with very large C codebases, like Postgres happens to be.
