Add the system identifier to backup manifests.  
  
Before this patch, if you took a full backup on server A and then  
tried to use the backup manifest to take an incremental backup on  
server B, it wouldn't know that the manifest was from a different  
server and so the incremental backup operation could potentially  
complete without error. When you later tried to run pg_combinebackup,  
you'd find out that your incremental backup was and always had been  
invalid. That's poor timing, because nobody likes finding out about  
backup problems only at restore time.  
  
With this patch, you'll get an error when trying to take the (invalid)  
incremental backup, which seems a lot nicer.
