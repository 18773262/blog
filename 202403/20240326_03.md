## 背景      
Allow locking updated tuples in tuple_update() and tuple_delete()  
  
The heap table access method saves some effort by checking the updated tuple once instead of twice.  Future undo-based table access methods, which will start from the latest row version, can immediately place a lock there.

Allow locking updated tuples in tuple_update() and tuple_delete()  
  
Currently, in read committed transaction isolation mode (default), we have the  
following sequence of actions when tuple_update()/tuple_delete() finds  
the tuple updated by the concurrent transaction.  
  
1. Attempt to update/delete tuple with tuple_update()/tuple_delete(), which  
   returns TM_Updated.  
2. Lock tuple with tuple_lock().  
3. Re-evaluate plan qual (recheck if we still need to update/delete and  
   calculate the new tuple for update).  
4. Second attempt to update/delete tuple with tuple_update()/tuple_delete().  
   This attempt should be successful, since the tuple was previously locked.  
  
This commit eliminates step 2 by taking the lock during the first  
tuple_update()/tuple_delete() call.  The heap table access method saves some  
effort by checking the updated tuple once instead of twice.  Future  
undo-based table access methods, which will start from the latest row version,  
can immediately place a lock there.  
  
Also, this commit makes tuple_update()/tuple_delete() optionally save the old  
tuple into the dedicated slot.  That saves efforts on re-fetching tuples in  
certain cases.  
  
The code in nodeModifyTable.c is simplified by removing the nested switch/case.
