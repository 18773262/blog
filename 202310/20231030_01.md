Introduce pg_stat_checkpointer  
  
Historically, the statistics of the checkpointer have been always part  
of pg_stat_bgwriter.  This commit removes a few columns from  
pg_stat_bgwriter, and introduces pg_stat_checkpointer with equivalent,  
renamed columns (plus a new one for the reset timestamp):  
- checkpoints_timed -> num_timed  
- checkpoints_req -> num_requested  
- checkpoint_write_time -> write_time  
- checkpoint_sync_time -> sync_time  
- buffers_checkpoint -> buffers_written  
  
The fields of PgStat_CheckpointerStats and its SQL functions are renamed  
to match with the new field names, for consistency.  Note that  
background writer and checkpointer have been split into two different  
processes in commits 806a2aee3791 and bf405ba8e460.  The pgstat  
structures were already split, making this change straight-forward.  
  
Bump catalog version.
