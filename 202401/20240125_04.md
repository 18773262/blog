## 背景     
pg_stat_progress_copy Add progress reporting of skipped tuples during COPY FROM.    
  
copy from ON_ERROR 不为stop时, pg_stat_progress_copy.tuples_skipped 表示copy from跳过的错误tuples计数.  
```  
+        S.param4 AS tuples_excluded,  
+        S.param7 AS tuples_skipped  
```

Add progress reporting of skipped tuples during COPY FROM.  
  
9e2d870119 enabled the COPY command to skip malformed data, however  
there was no visibility into how many tuples were actually skipped  
during the COPY FROM.  
  
This commit adds a new "tuples_skipped" column to  
pg_stat_progress_copy view to report the number of tuples that were  
skipped because they contain malformed data.  
  
Bump catalog version.
