## 背景    
[《PostgreSQL 17 preview - 内置块级别物理增量备份(INCREMENTAL backup/pg_combinebackup)功能》](../202312/20231222_01.md)    
  
pg_walsummary是wal summerize统计信息的分析工具. 可以用于观察增量备份可能涉及哪些数据文件, 以及数据块个数.

Add new pg_walsummary tool.  
  
This can dump the contents of the WAL summary files found in  
pg_wal/summaries. Normally, this shouldn't really be something anyone  
needs to do, but it may be needed for debugging problems with  
incremental backup, or could possibly be useful to external tools.

pg_walsummary — print contents of WAL summary files  
  
A WAL summary file is indexed by tablespace OID, relation OID, and relation fork(main,vm,fsm,init).   
  
For each relation fork, it stores the list of blocks that were modified by WAL within the range summarized in the file.   
  
It can also store a "limit block," which is 0 if the relation fork was created or truncated within the relevant WAL range, and otherwise the shortest length to which the relation fork was truncated.   
  
If the relation fork was not created, deleted, or truncated within the relevant WAL range, the limit block is undefined or infinite and will not be printed by this tool.
