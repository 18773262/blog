## 背景     
pg 16支持了standby开启逻辑复制.  
- [《PostgreSQL 16 preview - standby将支持逻辑复制》](../202304/20230403_01.md)    
  
PG 17支持logical replication slot failover.   
- [《PostgreSQL 17 preview - 支持逻辑复制槽failover to 流复制standby节点. `pg_create_logical_replication_slot(... failover = true|false ...)`》](../202401/20240126_01.md)    
  
也就是在主节点开启逻辑复制后, slot信息将同步给standby节点, 如果发生了切换(standby激活变成primary), 那么逻辑复制将会继续.  为了保证逻辑复制订阅内容复制且仅复制一次, 必须保证primary logical slot的应用位点信息同步给standby.  
  
pg 17 通过在standby调用pg_sync_replication_slots()函数, 对设置了failover标记的slot启用应用位点同步, 确保switchover/failover时slot位点正确.

Add a slot synchronization function.  
  
This commit introduces a new SQL function pg_sync_replication_slots()  
which is used to synchronize the logical replication slots from the  
primary server to the physical standby so that logical replication can be  
resumed after a failover or planned switchover.   
  
A new 'synced' flag is introduced in pg_replication_slots view, indicating  
whether the slot has been synchronized from the primary server. On a  
standby, synced slots cannot be dropped or consumed, and any attempt to  
perform logical decoding on them will result in an error.  
  
// 启用sync的方法  
The logical replication slots on the primary can be synchronized to the hot standby by   
1 using the 'failover' parameter of pg-create-logical-replication-slot(),   
2 or by using the 'failover' option of CREATE SUBSCRIPTION during slot creation,   
3 and then calling pg_sync_replication_slots() on standby.   
  
// 启用sync的前提条件  
For the synchronization to work,   
1 it is mandatory to have a physical replication slot between the primary and the standby   
2 aka 'primary_slot_name' should be configured on the standby,   
3 and 'hot_standby_feedback' must be enabled on the standby.   
4 It is also necessary to specify a valid 'dbname' in the 'primary_conninfo'.  
  
If a logical slot is invalidated on the primary, then that slot on the  
standby is also invalidated.  
  
If a logical slot on the primary is valid but is invalidated on the  
standby, then that slot is dropped but will be recreated on the standby in  
the next pg_sync_replication_slots() call provided the slot still exists  
on the primary server. It is okay to recreate such slots as long as these  
are not consumable on standby (which is the case currently). This  
situation may occur due to the following reasons:  
- The 'max_slot_wal_keep_size' on the standby is insufficient to retain  
WAL records from the restart_lsn of the slot.  
- 'primary_slot_name' is temporarily reset to null and the physical slot  
is removed.  
  
The slot synchronization status on the standby can be monitored using the  
'synced' column of pg_replication_slots view.  
  
A functionality to automatically synchronize slots by a background worker  
and allow logical walsenders to wait for the physical will be done in  
subsequent commits.
